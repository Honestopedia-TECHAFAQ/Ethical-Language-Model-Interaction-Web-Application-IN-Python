## Usage

1. Input your query in the text area provided.
2. Optionally, upload an image for multimodal input.
3. Click on the "Generate Response" button to generate a response from the LLM model.
4. The generated response, along with any bias mitigation applied, will be displayed on the interface.

## Ethical Considerations

- The application aims to mitigate biases in the model's responses by detecting and addressing biases related to gender using word embeddings.
- Bias detection and mitigation techniques are applied to ensure fairness in the model's predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional bias detection techniques for other sensitive attributes (e.g., race, ethnicity).
- Enhance multimodal input support with audio input capabilities.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for collecting user feedback on generated responses.
